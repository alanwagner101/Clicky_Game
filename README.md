# Clicky Game

This game was my first build using react
The point of the game is to click each picture without picking the same picture twice.
The pictures shuffle every time you make a selection and if it has not already been selected you will receive a point.

This game was a trial run for making a functioning react application and I think it went well. React feels very powerful and I look forward to creating more apps using it. 

I hope you enjoy my game!
